        - [CMS Medicare Coverage Database](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/downloads/downloads.aspx)

2. **Data Extraction and Standardization**:
    - Develop an algorithm to automatically extract medical necessity criteria from the aforementioned sources.
    - Standardize the extracted data to maintain consistency across categories or insurers, and keeping the text structure (medical necessity, coding, etc)
3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
    - Design and implement a set of evaluation criteria to assess the performance of your extraction algorithm.
    - Criteria may include accuracy, completeness of data extraction, consistency across different data sources, efficiency of the process, and scalability.
