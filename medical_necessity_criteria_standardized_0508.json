    "text": "For members with visual disability with a Snellen Acuity of 20/50 or worse, cataract surgery is considered medically necessary when all of the following subjective, objective, and educational criteria are met: Subjective: The member perceives that his or her ability to carry out needed or desired activities is impaired. The member's decision is based on: the member's own assessment of visual disability (e.g., impact on driving, viewing television, and special occupational or avocational needs) and, in particular, disability at near sight (e.g., reading, occupational activities requiring near vision); and the member's perception of the impact of the visual disability on lifestyle (e.g., loss of independence, loss of income). Note: Functional impairment due to cataracts refers to lost or diminished ability to perform everyday activities, participate in hobbies or other leisure-time activities, or to work in one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s occupation. Several instruments such as the VF-14, the activities of daily vision scale and the visual activities questionnaire are available for assessing functional impairment related to cataract. In general, driving an automobile is the limiting life-style activity with visual acuity in the 20/50 to 20/60 range. Almost all states require 20/40 vision in one eye to get a driver's license. Household activities and reading are usually not limiting until the member reaches 20/70 vision. Objective: The best correctable Snellen visual acuity in the affected eye is 20/50 or worse, The eye examination confirms that the cataract is the limiting factor for improving visual function when other factors do not preclude improvement following surgery, and The member's medical and mental health permits surgery to be performed safely. Educational: The member has been educated about the risks and benefits of cataract surgery, including alternatives to treatment and the member determines if the expected reduction in the disability outweighs the potential risk, cost and inconvenience of surgery.",

Several instruments such as the VF-14, the activities of daily vision scale and the visual activities questionnaire are available for assessing functional impairment related to cataract. In general, driving an automobile is the limiting life-style activity with visual acuity in the 20/50 to 20/60 range. Almost all states require 20/40 vision in one eye to get a driver's license. Household activities and reading are usually not limiting until the member reaches 20/70 vision.",
